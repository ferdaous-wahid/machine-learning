# machine-learning process
1. Data pre-processing
  * Import data
  * Clean the data
  * Split into training & test set
2. Modeling
  * Build the model
  * Train the model
  * Prediction
3. Evaluation
  * Calculate performance metrics
  * Make a verdict

**Feature Scaling is always applied to columns** <br>

##Types of feature scaling <br>

| `Normalization` | X' = (X-Xmin) / (Xmax-Xmin) | `[0 or 1]` | <br>
| `Standardization` | X' = (X - η) / σ | `[-3; +3]`
